# [v1.0.0 ðŸŒˆ](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 23 June 2023

## Changes

- feature: support AWS Provider 5.x [@jharley](https://github.com/jharley) ([#53](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/issues/53))
- feature: Moving `s3_configuration {}` from root block to `http_endpoint_configuration` [@ryan-keswick](https://github.com/ryan-keswick) | ([#49]https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/issues/49())

Note: this drops support for AWS Provider 4.x. If you are still on v4 of the AWS provider, please continue to use v0.5.0 of this module.

# [v0.5.0 ðŸŒˆ](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 22 June 2023

## Changes

# [v0.4.0 ðŸŒˆ](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 11 May 2023

## Changes

- fix: be explicit about S3 access policies [@dstrelau](https://github.com/dstrelau) ([#45](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/issues/45))
  - This is technically a breaking change, in that it changes the exact resources created by the root module, but AWS changed the defaults of S3 buckets such that the old version does not work. The new resources match the new AWS defaults and are functionally equivalent to the old ones (ensuring the S3 is completely private). Only users of the root module should see a diff. Individual sub-modules are not effected.
