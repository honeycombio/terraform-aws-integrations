# RELEASING

## VERSIONING

This follows the [recommendation from the HashiCorp team](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/modules/publish#releasing-new-versions): each tag and release has a semantic version optionally prefixed with a `v` (i.e. v1.0.1 or 0.9.4).

## MAKING A NEW RELEASE

Follow these steps to create a new release:

* Open the [Releases Page](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/releases).


* If there are new changes since the last release, you will see a draft release with notes and a recommended tag / name - this is created by [release-drafter](.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml).
 

* Review and make changes to the content or version number.


* Save. DO NOT PUBLISH YET.


* Locally, run `make update-changelog`. We do this before publishing so our new release includes the commit with the latest version controlled CHANGELOG.md file.


* Open a PR and merge in once approved.


* PUBLISH the Release. ðŸŽ‰


* Validate & Celebrate - https://registry.terraform.io/modules/honeycombio/{{cookiecutter.module_name}}/{{cookiecutter.provider}}/latest.
