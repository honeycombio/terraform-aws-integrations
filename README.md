# TERRAFORM AWS INTEGRATIONS
=============================

[![CI](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/actions/workflows/test-terraform-module.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/actions?query=Test%20Terraform%20Module)

This module creates resources in AWS to set up integrations that send data to Honeycomb.

## What does this module do?

This module sets up various resources in AWS required to send olly data from AWS services to Honeycomb. 


Current Integrations supported are:

* Cloudwatch Logs
* Load Balancer Logs

## Use

The minimal config is:

```hcl
module "honeycomb-aws-integrations" {
  source = "honeycombio/integrations/aws"

  name = "terraform-honeycomb-aws-integrations" // A name for the Integration.

  #aws lb integration
  s3_bucket_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::testing-alb" // The full ARN of the bucket storing load balancer access logs.
  kms_key_arn   = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

  #aws cloudwatch integration
  cloudwatch_log_groups = ["/aws/lambda/S3LambdaHandler-test"] // CloudWatch Log Group names to stream to Honeycomb.
  s3_bucket_name        = "terraform-aws-integrations-test"
  // A name for the S3 bucket that will store any logs that failed to be sent to Honeycomb.

  #honeycomb
  honeycomb_api_key      = var.HONEYCOMB_API_KEY // Honeycomb API key.
  honeycomb_dataset_name = "terraform-aws-integrations-test" // Your Honeycomb dataset name that will receive the logs.
}
```

Set the API key used by Terraform setting the HONEYCOMB_API_KEY environment variable.

```bash
export TF_VAR_HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=$HONEYCOMB_API_KEY
```

Setup AWS credentials for the intended AWS account where the resources will be created and managed.

Now you can run `terraform plan/apply` in sequence.

For more config options, see [USAGE.md](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/blob/main/USAGE.md).

## Examples

Examples of use of this module can be found
in [`examples/`](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/tree/main/examples).

## Development

### Tests

Test cases that run against local code are
in [`tests/`](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/tree/main/tests)
. To set up:

1. Set the API key used by Terraform setting the TF_VAR_HONEYCOMB_API_KEY environment variable.

2. Setup AWS credentials.

3. Run `terraform init`

4. `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` will now work as expected, as will
   `terraform destroy`.

5. Test cases also run as part of the pipeline.
   See [test-terraform-module.yml](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-terraform-module.yml)

### Docs

Docs are autogenerated by running `make generate-docs`, and put
in [USAGE.md](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-aws-integrations/blob/main/USAGE.md).

Please regenerate and commit before merging.

### Linters

We use [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) and `terraform
fmt`, and enforce this with a [github action](.github/workflows/tflint.yml).

You can run `make terraform-format` to auto fix formatting issues.
